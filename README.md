# Build Week: Back End Development

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past 4 weeks and apply them in a concrete project. The `Back End Development` unit explored the following topics: `Building RESTful Web APIs with Express and Node.js`, `Server-side Routing`, `Express Middleware`, `Deployment and Good Practices`, `Introduction to Relational Databases and SQL`, `Inserting and Modifying Data`, `Querying Data, Migrations and Seeding`, `Introduction to Data Modeling`, `Introduction to Authentication`, `Using Sessions and Cookies`, `Using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)`, `Client Side Authentication`, `Introduction to Automated Testing`, `Testing React Applications`, `Testing Web APIs`. For your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by working with a student of the Web Applications Development unit to create a Back-end Web Application which you can select from a list of potential options or create as a product of your own design.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Project.**

This is a project that you will work on, - and demonstrate your abilities to collaborate - with another student. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding weeks.

You will collaborate with a student from the Web Application Development unit during throughout the duration of the project.

You have Mon - Friday afternoon to complete this project. Please plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. Follow standard Lambda School Operating Procedures the same way you do with your daily afternoon assignments. Be sure to create a new repository and add your Project Manager as a collaborator to the project. This helps you, your team member and your project managers.

## Description

In this challenge, you will create a Back-end Web Application that will include the following items [NEED TO INSERT ITEMS HERE]_end result_.

[Include any GIFs or images to inspire working solutions. Make it clear whether this material is hard (students must reproduce) or soft (students must create an equivalent).]

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your application will be able to HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW as demonstrated in the following screen-shot. Note PERTINENT DETAILS OF THIS GRAPHIC IMAGE THAT THE STUDENT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

- [List out the steps it will take to complete the MVP very clearly.]
- [Required and optional steps can co-exist in the MVP.]

In your solution, it is essential that you follow industry standards and common practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts to much and does not.

[Validate your work through testing and ensure that your code operates as designed.]
